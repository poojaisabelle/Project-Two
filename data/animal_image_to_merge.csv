Alpine She-oak Skink,https://ZoosVic-Endpoint-Blob-Prod.azureedge.net/cache/0/c/3/1/9/3/0c3193f6d812bb240f0136e67cac83cb99073e87.jpg,Alpine She-oak Skink sunning it self on a rock with its tongue out.,"Found in only a few locations in Victoria and NSW, the Alpine She-oak Skink is listed as endangered.","Major threats
Fire is a huge danger to the Alpine She-Oak Skink. It kills individual skinks and destroys the understory vegetation. This makes any survivors vulnerable to predators.
Climate change is obviously a threat to all alpine areas. So is grazing and trampling by cattle and feral horses. The skink's habitat is also disturbed by the construction and maintenance of ski resorts and roads."

Greater Glider,https://www.environment.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0024/440367/Greater-Glider-black-Steve-Smith.jpg,Greater Glider,,"Species InformationThe Greater Glider is Australia’s largest gliding mammal. Greater Gliders have thick, dark grey-brown fur on their back and creamy white fur on their under-side, and can be found in different dark and light-coloured morphs. They have a long, furry prehensile tail and large furry ears.Greater Gliders are found along the east coast of mainland Australia, from central Queensland to central Victoria. Within Victoria, Greater Gliders are distributed throughout forested parts of eastern Victoria, including inland and southern falls of the Great Dividing Range, as well as the Strzelecki and Strathbogie Ranges. In eastern Victoria, Greater Gliders are absent from high altitude alpine and sub-alpine habitats, Wilson’s Promontory and cleared areas. They can be found as far west as Daylesford and the surrounding forested areas but do not occur in the Otway Ranges.Greater Gliders are forest dependent and prefer older tree age classes in moist forest types. They use hollow-bearing trees for shelter and nesting, with each family group using multiple den trees within its home range. They eat mainly young eucalypt leaves, with a preference for certain species.ThreatsGiven their high dependence on forest and large hollow-bearing trees, habitat loss and fragmentation through clearing and bushfires pose a threat to Greater Gliders. Climate change may also contribute to the contraction of suitable habitat. Fragmented populations have a reduced ability to recolonise suitable habitat and are at risk of genetic decline.Some populations have been found to have an increased risk of predation from Powerful Owls.What’s being doneThere has been an array of recent surveys conducted for the Greater Glider, including:surveys of the Strathbogie Ranges in 2017 to determine distribution and abundance;pre-harvest surveys of proposed timber coupes as part of the Forest Protection Survey Program; andlandscape scale surveys as part of the modernisation of Victoria’s Regional Forest Agreements.Parks Victoria manages large areas of suitable habitat for the Greater Glider in the parks and reserves system.Greater Gliders are among the species being monitored as part of the long-term monitoring of montane ash forests in the Central Highlands conducted by the Australian National University.The Arthur Rylah Institute (part of DELWP) has developed habitat distribution models to assist in predicting where suitable habitat might occur.The University of Melbourne is undertaking spatial analyses to identify the best areas for long-term protection.Greening Australia is leading revegetation work across private land to expand and link habitat in the Strzelecki Ranges as part of the National Landcare Program.More information on new measures to protect this species can be found in the Action Statement.Who’s helpingConserving Victoria's threatened species requires a collaborative approach.

Hooded Plover,https://www.environment.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0030/428808/IMG_3825lr.jpg,Hooded Plover,"Species Information

Hooded Plovers are a resident shorebird found along the southern and eastern coasts of Australia. Hooded Plovers are ocean beach specialists, highly selective of beach habitats that support their survival and reproductive needs. Each pair occupies a distinct territory, and the species is widely dispersed.Hooded Plovers nest from August to March (and sometimes April), which overlaps with the peak period of human use of their beach habitats. They generally lay 1-3 eggs in a simple nest scrape on the beach above the high tide mark, foredune or dune, preferring open areas with sparse to no vegetation. Incubation is for 28 days and they use passive nest defence and heavy camouflage of the eggs to reduce the chances of predation.After hatching it takes 35 days until the chicks can fly. During this period, they are active on the beach needing to find their own food, being warned into hiding by calls from their parents. The chicks will run to cover and crouch until the perceived threat is gone and the parents call them out from hiding. The chicks require brooding in their first two weeks as they are unable to thermoregulate. They feed mostly at the water's edge and along the wrack line amongst beach cast seaweed. They commonly run from danger toward the dune and they crouch by or under shelter such as rocks, vegetation or beach debris.","Threats

Hooded Plovers often share their ocean beach habitats with people. Their habitat is suffering loss and degradation via coastal development, weed infestations and introductions of predators. Their nest defence strategy is to leave the nest when a predator approaches and stay distant from the eggs until the predator leaves and it is safe to return. If the adult remains away for too long or if disturbances are too frequent, the eggs can be exposed to harsh temperatures that lead to the death of the embryo inside or can be exposed to other approaching predators. People using beaches for recreation pose a high disturbance threat to incubating birds, and some threats have been identified as having higher disturbance impacts, for example dogs off leash and recreational activities."
